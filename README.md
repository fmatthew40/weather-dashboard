# Weather Dashboard:

# Description:
 My task was to create a weather dashboard.  I used an openweathermap.org api.  I used an api that would allow the user to enter a city name.  When a name is entered, my application fetches the data from the api.  Once this data is fetched, I then use that data to retrieve the longitude and latitude of the city.  The longitude and latitude are then used to fetch a different set of data.  This new set of data retrieves the uvi and the 5 day forecast for my weather application.  The data is then set to display on different parts of the webpage.  I added a color changing feature to the uvi.  This shows the user a color of green, yellow, orange, red, or purple depending on the level of uvi that is returned.  

# Technologies used to build the application:
